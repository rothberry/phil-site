              Hi! I'm Phil Roth, a recent Flatiron School graduate for Software Engineering. I went to school at Western Michigan University for Industrial and Entrepreneurial Engineering. After working in the field, I decided to focus my career towards software engineering and web development. I also began learning music production 12 years ago and have come to see sound design through a visual design lens which has supported my coding skills.
