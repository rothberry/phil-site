              Hi! I'm Phil Roth, a recent Flatiron School graduate for Software
              Engineering. I went to school at Western Michigan University for
              Industrial and Entrepreneurial Engineering. After working in the
              field, I decided to focus my career towards software engineering
              and web development. I also began learning music production 12
              years ago and have come to see sound design through a visual
              design lens which has supported my coding skills. For more info,
              check out my <a href="/projects">projects</a> &{" "}

              Engineering. I have been praised for my strong skills in product
              design, project management, and creativity that help teams meet
              deadlines and exceed expectations. I am a creative and driven
