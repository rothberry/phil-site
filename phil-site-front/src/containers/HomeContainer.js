              Full stack web developer with a passion for finding innovative
              solutions. With experience in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React
              as well as a Bachelorâ€™s in Entrepreneurial and Industrial
              Engineering. I have been praised for my strong skills in product
              design, project management, and creativity that help teams meet
              deadlines and exceed expectations. I am a creative and driven
              leader who thrives in challenging environments. I also began
              learning music production 12 years ago and have come to see sound
              design through a visual design lens which has supported my coding
              skills.
